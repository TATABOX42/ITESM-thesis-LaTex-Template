In this chapter, the conclusions derived from the results 
(chapter \ref{results}) are shown in section \ref{section_conclusions}. 
Additionally, future work and suggestions to extend the current investigation are shown in 
section \ref{section_future_work}.

\section{Conclusions} \label{section_conclusions}
% ***************************************

Evolutionary algorithms are helpful to solve optimization problems. 
We conclude that the hypothesis proposed (see section \ref{hypothesis}) is true, our 
evidence is that we solved the infinite monkey problem. 
\\
\\
As a final comment, we expect that experimental and computational 
advances will lead to better modeling and understanding of typing monkeys.

\section{Future work} \label{section_future_work}
% ***************************************

There are some research questions arising from this work which should be addressed.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Get real monkeys:} In order 
	to test experimentally our hypothesis, real monkeys are needed.
	\item \textbf{Pursue a scientific publication}.
\end{itemize}
